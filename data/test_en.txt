Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI has seen rapid advancements in recent years, especially in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Modern AI systems are powered by machine learning algorithms and large datasets, enabling them to recognize patterns, make predictions, and even generate human-like text. Despite its potential, AI also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, bias, and job displacement.
